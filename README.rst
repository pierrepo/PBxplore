**PBxplore** is a suite of tools dedicated to Protein Block (PB) analysis.
Protein Blocks are structural prototypes defined by
`de Brevern et al <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11025540>`_. The 3-dimensional local
structure of a protein backbone can be modelized as an 1-dimensional sequence of PBs.
In principle, any conformation of any amino acid could be represented by one of
the sixteen available Protein Blocks (see Figure 1).

PBxplore provides both a Python library and command-line tools. Basically, PBxplore can:

* **assign PBs** from either a PDB or either a molecular dynamics trajectory.
* use analysis tools to perform **statistical analysis** on PBs.
* use analysis tools to **study protein flexibility and deformability**.

For details, see the documentation at https://pbxplore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

Requirements
------------

PBxplore requires:

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.x (>= 3.3)
* the `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ Python library,

Optionally, PBxplore can use:

* the `MDAnalysis <https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/>`_ Python library (version >= 0.11) to read MD trajectories generated by Gromacs (.xtc files),
* the `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ Python library to generate plots.
* `WebLogo 3 <http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/>`_ to create logo from PB sequences.


Installation
------------

Once dependencies installed, the most straightforward way is to use `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pbxplore


PBxplore can also be installed for the current user only:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --user pbxplore
