**PBxplore** is a suite of tools dedicated to Protein Block analysis. Protein Blocks are structural prototypes defined by [de Brevern](http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/~debrevern/index.php) *et al* [1]. Their main interest is to modelize the 3-dimensional local structure of the protein backbone into a 1-dimension sequence. In principle, any conformation of any amino acid could be represented by one of the sixteen available Protein Blocks (see Figure 1).
